## 2026-04-04 — Missing per-email rate limit on login endpoint

**Design reference:** `docs/detailed-designs/01-authentication/README.md`, Section 7.3 — Rate Limiting on Login

**Description:**
The design specifies layered rate limiting on `POST /api/auth/login`: 10 requests per minute per client IP address **and** 5 requests per 15 minutes per normalized email address. The implementation in `Program.cs` only registers the IP-based sliding-window policy (`login-ip`). The per-email rate limit policy (`login-email`) is entirely absent — neither registered in the rate limiter configuration nor enforced in the `AuthController` or login command handler. As a result, a single email account can be hammered indefinitely from different IP addresses, bypassing the email-level protection the design intends.

**Status:** FIXED
